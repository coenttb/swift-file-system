extension File.IO {
    /// A bounded pool for blocking I/O with configurable thread model.
    ///
    /// ## Thread Model
    /// The executor supports two thread models (configured via `Configuration.threadModel`):
    ///
    /// ### Cooperative (default)
    /// Uses Swift's cooperative thread pool via `Task.detached`. This means:
    /// - Blocking syscalls consume cooperative threads
    /// - Under sustained load, this can starve unrelated async work
    /// - `workers` bounds concurrency but does not provide dedicated threads
    ///
    /// ### Dedicated
    /// Uses dedicated `DispatchQueue` instances with explicit QoS:
    /// - Each worker has its own dispatch queue (user-initiated QoS)
    /// - Blocking I/O does not interfere with Swift's cooperative pool
    /// - Better isolation under sustained blocking operations
    ///
    /// ## Lifecycle
    /// - Lazy start: workers spawn on first `run()` call
    /// - **Fail-pending shutdown**: queued jobs fail with `.shutdownInProgress`
    /// - **The `.default` executor does not require shutdown** (process-scoped)
    ///
    /// ## Backpressure
    /// - Queue is bounded by `queueLimit` (ring buffer, O(1))
    /// - Callers suspend if queue is full
    /// - Cancellation while waiting removes the enqueue request
    ///
    /// ## Completion Guarantees
    /// - **Jobs run to completion once enqueued**
    /// - If caller is cancelled after enqueue, they receive `CancellationError`
    ///   (but the job still completes in the background)
    /// - `run()` after `shutdown()` throws `.shutdownInProgress`
    ///
    /// ## Handle Store
    /// The executor owns a handle store for managing stateful file handles.
    /// Use `registerHandle`, `withHandle`, and `destroyHandle` for handle operations.
