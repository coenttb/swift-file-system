extension File.Handle {
    /// An async-safe file handle wrapper.
    ///
    /// This actor provides async methods for file I/O operations while ensuring
    /// proper resource management and thread safety.
    ///
    /// ## Architecture
    /// The actor does NOT directly own the `File.Handle`. Instead:
    /// - The primitive `File.Handle` lives in the executor's handle store
    /// - This actor holds only a `Handle.ID` (Sendable token)
    /// - All operations go through `io.withHandle(id) { ... }`
    ///
    /// This design solves Swift 6's restrictions on non-Sendable, non-copyable
    /// types in actors by keeping the linear resource in a thread-safe store
    /// and never moving it across async boundaries.
    ///
    /// ## Close Contract
    /// - `close()` must be called explicitly for deterministic release
    /// - If actor deinitializes without `close()`, best-effort cleanup only
    /// - Close errors from deinit cleanup are discarded
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```swift
    /// let handle = try await File.Handle.Async.open(path, mode: .read, io: executor)
    /// let data = try await handle.read(count: 1024)
    /// try await handle.close()
    /// ```

        /// The handle ID in the executor's store.
        private let id: File.IO.Handle.ID

        /// The executor that owns the handle store.
        private let io: File.IO.Executor

        /// Whether the handle has been closed.
        private var isClosed: Bool = false

        /// The path this handle was opened for (for diagnostics).

        /// Creates an async handle by registering a primitive handle with the executor.
        ///
        /// - Parameters:
        ///   - handle: The primitive handle (ownership transferred to executor store).
        ///   - io: The executor that will manage this handle.
        /// - Throws: `Executor.Error.shutdownInProgress` if executor is shut down.
