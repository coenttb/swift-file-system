## Why swift-file-system?

Foundation's `FileManager` and `URL` APIs are designed for simplicity, not performance or async correctness. This library exists to solve problems Foundation cannot:

| Problem | Foundation | swift-file-system |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Async iteration** | Blocks thread per entry | Batched async with 48x fewer executor hops |
| **File copy** | Always reads+writes bytes | APFS clone (0.2ms), kernel-assisted paths |
| **Durability control** | No control over fsync | `.full`, `.dataOnly`, `.none` modes |
| **Thread pool starvation** | Blocking I/O starves cooperative pool | Dedicated executor option isolates I/O |
| **Concurrency safety** | Requires manual synchronization | `Sendable` throughout, actor-isolated state |
| **Symlink handling** | Implicit, inconsistent | Explicit `followSymlinks` option everywhere |

If you need predictable async behavior, kernel-level optimizations, or fine-grained durability control, this library provides what Foundation cannot.

## Overview

swift-file-system provides a modern Swift interface for file system operations with focus on performance, safety, and async-first design. Built on POSIX and Windows APIs with platform-specific optimizations like APFS cloning on macOS and `copy_file_range`/`sendfile` on Linux.

## Design Guarantees

### What this library guarantees

- **Atomic writes**: Write-sync-rename pattern ensures no partial writes on crash (when durability is `.full` or `.dataOnly`)
- **Bounded memory**: Async executor queue is bounded; backpressure suspends callers when full
- **Fallback correctness**: Copy operations try fast paths first, fall back gracefully to manual loop
- **No data races**: Full Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance with `Sendable` types throughout
- **Graceful shutdown**: In-flight operations complete; pending operations fail with explicit error

### What this library does NOT guarantee

- **Cross-process consistency**: No file locking primitives (yet); concurrent access from multiple processes requires external coordination
- **Path normalization**: `File.Path` validates structure (no NUL bytes, no empty components) but does not resolve `..`, symlinks, or canonicalize case
- **Windows path semantics**: UNC paths (`\\server\share`) and drive-relative paths (`C:foo`) are not fully validated
- **Security sandbox**: This is not a security boundary; path traversal prevention is best-effort, not hardened

Use `File.Path` for structured path manipulation, but do not rely on it as a security mechanism.

## Features

- **Kernel-assisted file copy**: APFS cloning (0.2ms for 100MB), `copyfile()` on Darwin, `copy_file_range`/`sendfile` on Linux
- **Batched directory iteration**: 48x speedup by reducing executor hops from N to N/64
- **Async streaming**: `AsyncSequence` for file bytes, directory entries, and recursive walks
- **Atomic writes**: Crash-safe write-sync-rename pattern with configurable durability modes
- **Dedicated I/O executor**: Actor-based thread pool that doesn't starve Swift's cooperative pool
- **Validated paths**: `File.Path` rejects NUL bytes, empty components, and embedded newlines
- **Swift 6 strict concurrency**: Full `Sendable` compliance, no data races
- **Cross-platform**: macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows support

    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-file-system.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Add to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "File System", package: "swift-file-system"),
    ]
)
```

### Requirements

- Swift 6.2+
- macOS 26.0+, iOS 26.0+, or Linux
- Xcode 26.0+ (for Apple platforms)

## Quick Start

### File Operations

```swift
import File_System

// Create a file reference
let file: File = "/tmp/data.txt"

// Read and write
let data = try file.read()                    // sync
let data = try await file.read()              // async

try file.write("Hello, World!")               // sync
try await file.write("Hello, World!")         // async

// Append
try file.append(" More content")

// Check properties
if file.exists && file.isFile {
    print("Size: \(try file.size)")
    print("Empty: \(try file.isEmpty)")
}

// File operations
try file.copy(to: otherFile)
try file.move(to: newLocation)
try file.delete()
```

### Low-Level Handle Access

```swift
// Scoped handle access with automatic cleanup
try file.open { handle in
    let chunk = try handle.read(count: 1024)
}

try file.open.write { handle in
    try handle.write(bytes)
}

// Static API works too
try File.open(path).readWrite { handle in
    try handle.seek(to: 100)
    try handle.write(data)
}
```

### Directory Operations

```swift
let dir: File.Directory = "/tmp/mydir"

// Create and delete
try dir.create(withIntermediates: true)
try dir.delete(recursive: true)

// Contents
for entry in try dir.contents() {
    print(entry.name)
}

// Subscript access
let readme = dir[file: "README.md"]
let subdir = dir[directory: "src"]

// Async iteration (batched, 48x faster)
for try await entry in File.Directory.entries(at: dir.path) {
    print(entry.name)
}

// Recursive walk
for entry in try File.Directory.Walk(at: dir.path) {
    print("\(entry.depth): \(entry.path)")
}
```

### Sync and Async - Same API

The same method names work for both sync and async - Swift picks based on context:

```swift
// Convenience API
let data = try file.read()              // sync
let data = try await file.read()        // async

// Primitive API (for advanced options)
try File.System.Write.Atomic.write(data, to: path, options: .init(durability: .full))
try await File.System.Write.Atomic.write(data, to: path, options: .init(durability: .full))
```

### Streaming Bytes

```swift
// Async byte streaming with backpressure
for try await chunk in File.Stream.bytes(from: path) {
    process(chunk)
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Operations

```swift
let file: File = "/tmp/config.json"

// Simple read/write (uses safe defaults)
try file.write(jsonString)
let content = try file.readString()

// Copy and move
let backup = File("/tmp/config.backup.json")
try file.copy(to: backup)
try file.move(to: File("/tmp/new-location.json"))
```

### Advanced Write Options (Durability)

Use the primitive API when you need fine-grained control:

```swift
// Full durability (F_FULLFSYNC on Darwin, fsync on Linux)
try File.System.Write.Atomic.write(
    data,
    to: path,
    options: .init(durability: .full)
)

// Data-only sync (faster, metadata may be stale after crash)
try File.System.Write.Atomic.write(
    data,
    to: path,
    options: .init(durability: .dataOnly)
)

// No sync (fastest, for temporary files)
try File.System.Write.Atomic.write(
    data,
    to: path,
    options: .init(durability: .none)
)
```

### Advanced Copy Options

```swift
// Copy with attributes (permissions, timestamps)
try File.System.Copy.copy(
    from: source,
    to: destination,
    options: .init(copyAttributes: true, overwrite: true)
)

// Handle symlinks explicitly
try File.System.Copy.copy(
    from: source,
    to: destination,
    options: .init(followSymlinks: false)  // Copy symlink itself
)
```

### Directory Operations

```swift
let projectDir: File.Directory = "/Users/me/project"

// Create directory structure
try projectDir.create(withIntermediates: true)
let srcDir = projectDir[directory: "src"]
try srcDir.create()

// List contents
let files = try projectDir.files()
let subdirs = try projectDir.subdirectories()

// Check if empty
if try projectDir.isEmpty {
    try projectDir.delete()
}

// Copy/move directories
try projectDir.copy(to: File.Directory("/tmp/backup"))
try projectDir.move(to: File.Directory("/Users/me/new-project"))
```

### Directory Traversal with Filtering

```swift
// Walk with options
let options = File.Directory.Walk.Options(
    followSymlinks: false,
    skipHidden: true,
    maxDepth: 5
)

for entry in try File.Directory.Walk(at: rootPath, options: options) {
    if entry.type == .regular && entry.name.hasSuffix(".swift") {
        print("Found Swift file: \(entry.path)")
    }
}
```

### Custom Executor (Advanced)

```swift
// For heavy I/O, use a dedicated executor to avoid starving the cooperative pool
let io = File.IO.Executor(.init(workers: 4, threadModel: .dedicated))

// Pass custom executor to any operation
let data = try await File.System.Read.Full.read(from: path, io: io)
for try await entry in File.Directory.entries(at: path, io: io) { ... }

// Explicit executors must be shut down when done
await io.shutdown()
```

## Performance

### File Copy

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| 100MB APFS clone | 0.2ms | Same filesystem, instant metadata copy |
| 100MB kernel copy | ~50ms | Cross-filesystem, `copyfile()` on Darwin |
| 100MB manual loop | ~150ms | 64KB buffer read/write fallback |

### Directory Iteration

| Approach | Time (1000 files) | Executor Hops |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Per-entry hop | 14.81ms | 1000 |
| Batched (64) | 0.31ms | 15 |
| **Speedup** | **48x** | |

### Memory Usage

The async executor maintains bounded memory regardless of workload:
- Queue limit prevents unbounded accumulation
- Batched iteration reduces intermediate allocations
- Handle store tracks open files without leaks

### Methodology

Performance numbers are indicative, not guarantees. Measured on:
- Apple Silicon M1 (8 cores), 24 GB RAM
- macOS 26.0, Swift 6.2
- Release builds (`swift build -c release`)
- Warm filesystem cache (files read once before timing)
- APFS filesystem on internal NVMe SSD

Your results will vary based on hardware, filesystem, and workload characteristics.

## Architecture

### Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 File System                 │  ← Public API: File, File.Directory
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   File System Primitives + Async (internal) │  ← Sync/async ops, platform abstraction
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│          POSIX / Windows / Darwin           │  ← System calls
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### API Levels

| Level | Types | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Convenience** | `File`, `File.Directory` | Most common operations |
| **Open/Handle** | `file.open`, `File.Handle` | Scoped low-level access |
| **Primitive** | `File.System.*` | Advanced options (durability, symlinks) |

### Copy Fallback Ladder

| Platform | Fallback Order |
|----------|----------------|
| **Darwin** | `copyfile(CLONE_FORCE)` → `copyfile(ALL/DATA)` → manual loop |
| **Linux** | `copy_file_range` → `sendfile` → manual loop |
| **Windows** | `CopyFileW` → manual loop |

### I/O Executor

- **Cooperative mode** (default): Uses `Task.detached`, shares Swift's cooperative pool
- **Dedicated mode**: Per-worker `DispatchQueue`, isolates blocking I/O
- **Backpressure**: Bounded queue with suspension when full
- **Graceful shutdown**: Completes in-flight work, fails pending jobs

## Platform Support

### Core Filesystem Operations

| Platform | Status | Optimizations |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| macOS | Full | APFS cloning, `copyfile()`, kernel-assisted copy |
| iOS | Full | Same as macOS |
| Linux | Full | `copy_file_range`, `sendfile` |
| Windows | WIP | `CopyFileW`, see note below |

### Async I/O

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS | Full | Cooperative and dedicated thread models |
| iOS | Full | Same as macOS |
| Linux | Full | Same as macOS |
| Windows | WIP | Executor architecture ready |

### File Watching

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS | Planned | FSEvents integration pending |
| iOS | Planned | FSEvents integration pending |
| Linux | Planned | inotify integration pending |
| Windows | Planned | ReadDirectoryChangesW pending |

### Windows Status

Windows support is work in progress. The library code is designed for Windows (with `CopyFileW`, Windows path handling, etc.), but builds are currently blocked by a dependency ([swift-standards](https://github.com/swift-standards/swift-standards)) using filenames with `<` and `>` characters that NTFS does not support.

## Non-goals

This library intentionally does not provide:

- **Virtual filesystem abstraction**: No pluggable backends or mock filesystems. Use protocol abstraction at a higher layer if needed.
- **Security sandbox**: Path validation is structural, not a security boundary. Do not use `File.Path` to prevent directory traversal attacks in untrusted input.
- **Database replacement**: For transactional semantics across multiple files, use SQLite or a proper database.
- **Watcher-first design**: File watching is planned but not the primary focus. For complex watching needs, consider dedicated solutions.
- **Complete Windows parity**: Windows support covers core operations; advanced features (ACLs, alternate data streams) are not prioritized.
